# Evolution-of-Modern-Deep-Learning-Methods-of-Object-Detection
This project explored one-stage (e.g., YOLO) and two-stage (e.g., RCNN) object detection methods using the Global Wheat Detection Dataset. It expanded understanding, laying a foundation for future applications, advancing computer vision, and enhancing object detection in diverse domains
